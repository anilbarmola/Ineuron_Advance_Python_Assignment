    "<b>Ans</b>: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n",

    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "Some Advantages are mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making problem solving easy through the use of objects\n",
    "Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
